# 12956 Motion Planning

A calibration and testing project based on [Road Runner](https://github.com/acmerobotics/road-runner).

This project has been merged into [FTC-12956-Frenzy](https://github.com/OwenBachyrycz/FTC-12956-Frenzy), and is now deprecated.

Do not use this project when using motion planning on the robot, use the Frenzy project instead.
